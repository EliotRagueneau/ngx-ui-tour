# [1.1.0](https://github.com/hakimio/ngx-ui-tour) (2023-01-26)

### Features
- New `centerAnchorOnScroll` config. Enable to keep active anchor element centered when possible. "Safari" currently
  does not support this feature.
- New `smoothScroll` config. Activate to use smooth scroll when scrolling to tour anchor element. Animations have to be
  enabled on OS level for it to work. Controlled by "Animate controls and elements inside windows" setting on Windows OS.
- New `disablePageScrolling` config. The config only disables "page-level" scroll and will not disable scroll on 
any deeply nested containers. Implementation is based on Angular CDK "BlockScrollStrategy".

### Fixes
- UI Tour now automatically ends on any navigation which was not started by the tour itself. Before only browser's back
  and forward navigation would cause the tour to end.
